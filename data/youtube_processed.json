Decided for the yoga pro 9i because the price difference (even during black friday deals) is just is just too high and I'm normally not very price sensitive. But the yoga pro 9i with 64GB Ram and 5070 GPU is about 2.000€ and the same config for T1G is about 3.800€. Another reason was, that I will buy a new Panther Lake Notebook next year, where I believe this will be a huge step forward from Intel. PS: Love and alwys watch your reviews. Great job!",

    "body":"Not a regular viewer here: this was a banger. Well argued and succinct, and good to see a creative with a large platform taking an actual stance on the use of generative AI in games. I'm a member of a handful of creator programs myself, and my concerns about AI generated content have been met with resistance and conflict avoidance. my peers in the field mysteriously piping up to be like \"wow, things are getting heated in here\" because I brought up criticism of generative AI, as though critique itself was the issue. And maybe it is for those creators and that context, where criticism is not seen as the act of love that it is, and so to negatively speak about things in their mind risks the connections they have to developers. it's an intensely frustrating experience, so to see the stand you've taken and to say that the game is a \"moral failure\" is such a breath of fresh air. i look forward to future videos, and will probably head back to see your legacy reviews too. thank you for making this video!",
