Was thinking long about the T1G vs YOGA pro 9i as my secondary home Laptop (for light gaming sometime). Decided for the yoga pro 9i because the price difference (even during black friday deals) is just is just too high and I'm normally not very price sensitive. But the yoga pro 9i with 64GB Ram and 5070 GPU is about 2.000€ and the same config for T1G is about 3.800€. Another reason was, that I will buy a new Panther Lake Notebook next year, where I believe this will be a huge step forward from Intel. PS: Love and alwys watch your reviews.

I wanted to work on these large games as a kid, but the industry is not what I thought it was. Obviously not every AAA studio is akin to Activision-Blizzard with its AI practices, but the thought of using AI as an artist feels like the real creativity is simply gone. 

It is very disheartening to see the reality of my childhood dream.
