## 0:00 - Introduction
**(Scene: Dashboard Landing Page - Executive Summary)**

"Hi! This is a walkthrough of the **Improvado Marketing Intelligence Dashboard**, a tool designed to unify your marketing data and customer feedback into one actionable view. We've built this to help marketing teams move from raw data to strategic decisions faster."

## 0:20 - Executive Summary (The "What")
**(Action: Mouse over KPI cards, then click 'Channel' button on sidebar)**

"First, we have the **Executive Summary**.
*   **What it shows:** At the top, you see your heartbeat metrics—Spend, CTR, Conversions—with real-time sparklines showing trends at a glance.
*   **Why it matters:** You don't need to dig through spreadsheets to know if you're on track. If 'Spend' is up but 'Conversions' are down, you see it instantly here."

**(Action: Hover over the main Time Series chart)**

"The central chart is interactive. By clicking these buttons on the right, I can instantly switch views from **Channel Performance** to **Campaign Performance**, allowing me to isolate exactly where our budget is going."

## 0:50 - AI Customer Voice (The "Why")
**(Action: Switch to 'AI Customer Voice' tab in sidebar)**

"Now, let's look at the **AI Customer Voice** section. This is where we go beyond *numbers* to understand *sentiment*.
*   **What it shows:** We're pulling real-time comments from YouTube and using AI to classify them as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
*   **Why it matters:** High engagement numbers are great, but not if the sentiment is negative. This dashboard tells you *how* people actually feel."

## 1:15 - Day-to-Day Usage Scenario
**(Action: Select 'Negative' in the Sentiment Filter)**

"Here is how a Brand Manager would use this day-to-day:
1.  **Morning Check:** I log in and see a spike in engagement on the Executive Dashboard.
2.  **Investigation:** I switch to this AI view.
3.  **Action:** I filter for **'Negative'** comments. Immediately, I see a thread about a pricing issue on our latest video.
4.  **Resolution:** I can now alert the support team before this becomes a PR crisis. This turns reactive fire-fighting into proactive management."

## 1:45 - Conclusion
**(Scene: Back to Executive Summary)**

"In short, this dashboard bridges the gap between **quantitative performance** and **qualitative feedback**, giving you the full story of your marketing impact. Thanks for watching!"
